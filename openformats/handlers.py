        Parses the template, finds the hashes, replaces them with strings from
        the stringset and returns the compiled file. If a hash in the template
        isn't found in the stringset, it's a good practice to remove the whole
        string section surrounding it

        Typically this is done in the following way:

        * Use a library or own code to segment (deserialize) the template into
          translatable entities, as if assuming that the hashes are the
          translatable entities.
        * Make sure the hash matches the first string in the stringset.
        * Replace the hash with the string.
        * Use library or own code to serialize stringset back into a compiled
          file.

        You can safely assume that the stringset will have strings in the
        correct order for the above process and thus you will probably be able
        to perform the whole compilation in a single pass.
